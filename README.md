# dotfiles

These are synced to Dropbox/dotfiles. To install them, use stow like `stow -v -d ~/Dropbox/dotfiles -t ~ <module>`. Your life will be easier if you just symlink Brewfile by hand and install that manually first from the homebrew module.

TBD: write an init script that does things that stow and Brewfile won't do for me like set options automatically
